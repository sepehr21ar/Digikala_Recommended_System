Machine Learning Product Recommendation System
This project builds a machine learning-based recommendation system for products. It leverages different machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Nearest Neighbors, to suggest products based on user interactions and product features.

Features:
Data Loading: Loads product data from a CSV file and prepares it for machine learning by encoding categorical features and handling missing values.
Data Visualization: Visualizes the distribution of ratings for products across different categories and subcategories.
Recommendation System: Based on a user's input product, it suggests similar products using a K-Nearest Neighbors model.
User-Based Recommendations: A different model predicts whether a user would recommend a product or not, using their historical interactions with products.
ML Models: Supports training and evaluation using different models, such as Random Forest, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), and others.
